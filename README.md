This is my readme file!

Here you can find my projects and assignments for my CART263 class at Concordia University.

# Pong Exercice

Here you can see my attempt at doing the pong game code. I tried to look at multiple tutorials/examples, but ultimately, I didn't manage to finish the exercice because I could barely understand what was going on with their code and didn't want to just copy-paste. I have a ball that is bouncing around, a line separating the canvas in two and two paddles that can be moved with the keys arrow up & down as well as w & s.

# Idea for my particle with personality project

For this project, I received the prompt "Looking for love".

- What does the system look like?
There are multiples strokes crossing the screen representing the path we take in life. Each separate line represents a different soul, a different individual. When two of them meet, an explosion of color/light happens and there is a pulsating effect reminding us of a heartbeat. It grows until it fills the screen and then slowly fades away. The animation then restarts.

- What kind of movements, colours, and shapes are involved?
The background is blue, with the strokes being a gradient pink. The strokes are bouncing around the screen. When the extremity of a stroke collide with another, a bright pink/yellow blob-shaped glow appear and start to pulsate and grow until it fills the screen. Then it fades away and the animation restarts.

- What does a particle being created look like? How long does it live? How does it get
destroyed?

- How long does a particle last? Forever? Until something happens to it?

- Are there multiple types of particles? Do they interact with each other or themselves?

- How do the particles interact with each other? How do they interact with the browser
or canvas borders?

- Do the particles interact with the viewer? If so, how?

- Are there time considerations? Do the individual particles change during their
lifespan? Does the lifespan of the entire particle system change over time?
