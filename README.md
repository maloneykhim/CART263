# Pong Exercice

Here you can see my attempt at doing the pong game code. I tried to look at multiple tutorials/examples, but ultimately, I didn't manage to finish the exercice because I could barely understand what was going on with their code and didn't want to just copy-paste. I have a ball that is bouncing around, a line separating the canvas in two and two paddles that can be moved with the keys arrow up & down as well as w & s.

# Idea for my particle with personality project

For this project, I received the prompt "Looking for love".
